# FluentEmailer - Email sender for .NET
This library is based on the excellent [FluentEmail](https://github.com/lukencode/FluentEmail) by Luke Lowrey, which, at the time I'm writing this, looks like it is not being maintained any longer (unfortunately).

> Note: This library is not compatible with .NET Framework projects.
